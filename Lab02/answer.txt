Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 
Because the types of title and category are String .
So the constructor method to build a DVD by title and category will have the same method signature .
In conclusion ,Java does not allow us to do this .
